## What is this all about?
Welcome to **Potato Diffusion**—a no-nonsense dive into building a diffusion model from the ground up. This repository is all about implementing the core components—VAE, CLIP, and UNet—using PyTorch, with a focus on simplicity and transparency.

## Why This Matters
- **Learn by Doing**: Build everything from scratch to truly understand how diffusion models work.
- **Core AI Components**: Master the architecture behind VAE, CLIP, and UNet.
- **Clean and Modular**: Code that's easy to read, extend, and experiment with.

## Quick Start
1. Clone the repository:
